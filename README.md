# Fake-News-Detection
I have used the following models Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Passive Aggressive classification models as well as RNN models such as LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM and GRULSTM Models with glove embedding to detect whether news is fake or real. 

### Dataset used

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bjoernjostein/fake-news-data-set
In data folder we have used only 2 data folder from tarin and testing dataset.

### Glove embedding used:
https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
Stanford Glove embedding for 200d words

### Result
I have obtained 79% precision and 77% AUC score for BiLSTM which is greater than other models, which makes it the best model to identify whether the news is real or fake.
